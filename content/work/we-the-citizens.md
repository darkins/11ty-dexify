# We the citizens

We the Citizens was an academic project designed to bring citizens into the heart of debates about in democracy in Ireland. Set up in the midst of Ireland’s economic crisis, it was the initiative of a group of academics: David M. Farrell, Jane Suiter, Eoin O’Malley and Elaine Byrne. It was funded by Atlantic Philanthropies. The project was managed by Caroline Erskine and a small team located in a Dublin city centre office.  The chairperson was Fiach MacConghail, the director of the Abbey Theatre.

The primary motivation for this project was to demonstrate the merits of a citizens’ assembly in an Irish context – to show that regular citizens could be included in processes like this.  We the Citizens ran a series of seven citizen meetings around the country, leading to an experimental citizens’ assembly in Dublin in June 2011 where a representative group of citizens were randomly chosen to attend.

The project tested whether a deliberative form of democracy could work in Ireland at a time when people felt adrift and disconnected from power. The research found striking shifts in how participants feel about their ability to influence politics. As a result of their participation in the citizens’ assembly participants showed a greater interest in politics, expressed more willingness to discuss and become involved in politics, and felt more positive about the ability of ordinary people to influence politics.

The findings were presented to the leaders of every party in Ireland (including the parties in government) in a series of bi-lateral meetings.

The model later became a template for the Irish Constitutional Convention and many of the academic team were invited to form the Academic and Legal Support Group of the Convention, with David Farrell appointed as the research director of the Convention and Jane Suiter as the deputy research director.
