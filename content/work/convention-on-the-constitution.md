# Convention on the constitution

In late 2012 the Irish government established the Convention on the Constitution, which followed many of the procedures spearheaded by We The Citizens — with randomly selected citizen members at the core and following carefully facilitated and informed small group discussions. It met for 14 months between December 2012 and February 2014.

The membership of the Convention comprises 66 citizens selected randomly from the greater population by a market research company and 33 legislators from the Irish parlaiment nominated by their respective parties and including representatives from the political parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The 100th member was the chair, Tom Arnold, a respected individual from the charity sector. The Academic and Legal Support Group for the Convention was made up of  David Farrell (research director), Jane Suiter (deputy research director), Clodagh Harris, Eoin O’Malley, and Lia O’Hegarty.

The Convention was tasked by the government with considering eight topics: the term of the Irish presidency; whether to reduce the voting age for citizens; electoral reform; the right for citizens outside the state to vote in presidential elections; marriage equality; the role of women in the Constitutional; the participation of women in politics and public life; and blasphemy.  In addition, the Convention added to further items to its agenda: parliamentary reform and whether to insert a clause on economics, social and cultural rights into the Constitution.

In total the Convention made 43 recommendations, 18 of which would require constitutional amendment by a referendum.  To date, there have been three referendums, two of which have been successful (on marriage equality in 2015 and blasphemy in 2018), and one unsuccessful (on reducing the age requirement of presidential candidates).  There has also been extensive parliamentary reforms. Further reforms are promised or still being considered. The current state of play is summarised in the following table.
