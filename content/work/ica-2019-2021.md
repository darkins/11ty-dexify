# Irish Citizens' Assembly (2019-2021)

It followed closely the model of the 2016- Citizens’ Assembly in having as its members 99 citizens selected at random by a leading market research company, Amárach Research, and an independent chair Catherine Day, former Secretary General of the European Commission. Jane Suiter (Research Fellow) and David Farrell led the research on the Assembly, funded by the Irish Research Council.
