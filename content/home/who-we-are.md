# Who we are

Over the past decade Professor David Farrell and Dr Jane Suiter have been collaborating in research focused on Irish citizens’ assemblies. In 2008/09 during the economic crisis David and Jane led a group of political scientists who proposed that citizens should be brought into the heart of debates over constitutional and political reform. This culminated in the establishment of <a href="/work/#wtc">We the Citizens</a> – Ireland’s first national citizens’ assembly. In 2012 the Irish government established the <a href="/work/#convention">Convention on the Constitution</a>: David and Jane led the academic advisory group. This was followed, in 2016, by the Irish Citizens’ Assembly: David and Jane secured <a href="https://research.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Research Council</a> funding to provide research leadership. In 2019 Jane and David once again secured Irish Research Council funding to carry out research on the current Citizens’ Assembly on Gender Equality.
